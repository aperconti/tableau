In this project I focused on how a citi bikes data set. The questions I tried to answers in this project were; 
1)How does subscriber status effect ride length?
2)How likely are males/females to be subscribers? 
3)Are there more male or female riders? 
4)What are the average ages of males/females?
5)What are the average ride length by male/female?

The reason I focused on these questions was because I thought they could help to discover the patterns of users as well as the subgroup of gender. 

### Analysis:

1)How does subscriber status effect ride length? 
Subscribers are much more likely to have more extended trips. This is likely because they are already invested/paying for a bike; therefore, it is a planned transportation choice.

2)How likely are males/females to be subscribers? 
Males are slightly more likely to be subscribers then females but the amount is nominal. 

3)Are there more male or female riders? 
There are 16,464 male riders and 5,499 female there are 22,962 riders with unrecorded genders which could account for the lower number of recorded females. 

4)What are the average ages of males/females?
The average age of women riders is just over 37 years old. The average age of male riders is 39 years old. 


5)What are the average ride length by male/female?
The average distance ridden by women is slightly over 10 minutes. This is about two mins longer than the average trip length taken by male riders. 


The fact that females on average have longer trip lengths is likely becaue younger Individuals are often more physically fit. Younger individuals are also more likely not to have young children, which could result in the individual having more time to enjoy recreational activities such as biking.
